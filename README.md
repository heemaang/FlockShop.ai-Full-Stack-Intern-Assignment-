## 🎯 Assumptions & Limitations

### Current Implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with localStorage (suitable for demo)
- **Invite System**: Mocked email invitation (no actual email sending)
- **Image URLs**: Must be valid image URLs (no file upload)
- **Database**: MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket-based with fallback to polling
- **Security**: Basic validation (production needs more robust security)

### Production Considerations
- Implement HTTPS and secure headers
- Add email verification and password reset
- Use Redis for session management
- Implement rate limiting and API throttling
- Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

## 🚀 Scaling & Future Improvements

### Short-term Enhancements
- **Email Integration**: Real email invitations with templates
- **File Upload**: Image upload with cloud storage
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced product search and filtering
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for updates
- **Export/Import**: Wishlist sharing via URL or file export

### Long-term Features
- **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter app
- **Payment Integration**: Direct purchase links
- **AI Recommendations**: Product suggestions based on preferences
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage statistics and insights
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
- **Advanced Permissions**: Role-based access control
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**
   ```bash
   # Ensure MongoDB is running locally
   mongod
   
   # Or check Atlas connection string
   # Verify IP whitelist includes your IP
   ```

2. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Kill process using port 5000
   npx kill-port 5000
   
   # Or change PORT in .env file
   PORT=5001
   ```

3. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure backend is running on correct port
   - Check CORS configuration in server.js
   - Verify frontend URL in CORS settings

4. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Check if Socket.IO server is running
   - Verify WebSocket URL in client
   - Check browser console for connection errors

5. **Authentication Issues**
   - Clear localStorage and re-login
   - Verify JWT_SECRET in .env
   - Check token expiration

### Development Commands

```bash
# Backend
cd server
npm run dev          # Start with nodemon
npm start           # Start production server
npm run test-connection  # Test database connection

# Frontend
cd client
npm run dev         # Start development server
